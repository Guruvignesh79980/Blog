# The Road to Kallur

The bus rumbled to life just as the first streaks of orange brushed the morning sky. Aarav slung his backpack onto the overhead rack and dropped into his seat, his heart thudding with the excited rhythm of someone escaping routine. For months he had dreamed of this trip—a spontaneous journey to the hill town of Kallur, far away from deadlines, expectations, and the constant buzzing of notifications.

The bus rolled out of the city, the buildings shrinking into silhouettes behind him. He leaned against the window, watching as the landscape shifted from concrete and chaos to fields rippling like green silk. The cool breeze slipped through the slightly open window, carrying the scent of wet earth from last night’s rain. It made him smile. It felt like the world had paused just for him.

Halfway through the journey, the bus made a stop at a tiny roadside tea stall. Aarav got down, stretching his legs, and ordered a cup of hot ginger tea. As he stood there sipping it, a dog trotted up, wagging its tail. Aarav crouched down and scratched behind its ears. “Going somewhere too?” he chuckled. The dog barked as if in agreement before darting away after a cyclist. A simple moment, but it warmed him more than the tea.

Back on the bus, the road began winding upward. The hills rose around them like old guardians draped in mist. Aarav pressed his forehead against the glass, mesmerised by waterfalls cascading down cliffs and tiny houses perched bravely on edges. Every turn felt like opening a new page of a story he didn’t know he needed.

By noon, the bus reached Kallur. Aarav stepped down, breathing in the crisp mountain air. The town was quiet, its charm tucked into cobblestone paths, wooden roofs, and shops selling handmade trinkets. He checked into a small homestay run by an elderly couple who welcomed him as though he were their own grandson.

After resting, he wandered into the forest trail behind the homestay. Sunlight filtered through the trees in golden beams, and the air smelled of pine and distant rain. Birds called to each other from hidden branches. Aarav felt something inside him loosen—something that had been wound tight for far too long.

A few kilometres in, he reached a viewpoint overlooking a vast valley. Clouds drifted lazily below, making it seem like he stood at the edge of the world. As he sat on a rock, the silence wrapped around him—not empty, but full, like the mountains were speaking in a language beyond words.

Aarav closed his eyes. No pings. No responsibilities pulling at him. Just breath, wind, and the steady beat of his own heart.

The trip hadn’t just taken him to Kallur. It had taken him back to himself.
